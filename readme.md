### Intro:

I have created a repository where I have employed and learned various tools that have proven to be invaluable in the field of data science. These tools are organized into the following steps of the data science process:

1. Discover the Data: Techniques for exploring and understanding the dataset, including data visualization and exploration tools.
2. Get the Data: Methods to collect and acquire the necessary data from various sources.
3. Prepare the Data: Tools for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
4. Model the Data: Utilizing algorithms and techniques to build predictive or descriptive models.
5. Modern Deep Learning Tools: Exploring contemporary tools and frameworks for deep learning applications.
6. Design the Output: Strategies for visualizing and presenting the results of data analysis effectively.
7. Narrate a Story: Techniques for storytelling with data, which involves communicating insights and findings to stakeholders.
8. Deploy Tools: Methods for deploying data science solutions into production environments."
